# PHP Function Missing Return Statement Bug
This repository demonstrates a common error in PHP: a missing return statement in a function. The function `calculateSum` is designed to compute the sum of an array of numbers; however, due to the missing `return` keyword, it does not return the intended result, leading to unexpected behavior.
The solution involves adding the missing `return` statement to the function to ensure that the calculated sum is correctly returned.
